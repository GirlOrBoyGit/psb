ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Bot version - 0.0.2 - **a huge update.**
*I think everyone has been waiting for this and we are releasing a huge update of the partner bot.*

â€¢ **Premium feature** - nevertheless, we added premium to the bot, but did not touch the main functionality, but made ____a new____ and unique function.
Auto-Bump - promotes your server without any help, 24/7. When you purchase, you also get the "Premium User" role and priority support.
Find out more in the command: `/premium`.<br>
â€¢ We have removed the bump confirmation button, but it will appear only once when you have invited the bot, and so it will not happen again.<br>
â€¢ In the `/stats` command, we added the ping of the message response and also added the "WebSite" and "Support Server" button.<br>
â€¢ Now, if someone else's user pokes a button, our bot will write that you do not have such opportunities.<br>
â€¢ We have added responses to complaints for users. If you have complained about some server, then you will receive a response "The complaint is approved" or vice versa. The message will also be sent to the creator of the server that the participant complained about.<br>
â€¢ Fixed a bug with 2FA protection.<br>
â€¢ Other bugs and errors have been fixed.
